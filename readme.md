# Fractals

Computing various fractals (currently only the manelbrot and julia sets)

Fun way to learn a new language

## Current implimentations

- Python
    - Mandelbrot set (slow, low resolution)
- C
    - Mandelbrot set
    - Julia sets
- OCaml
    - Mandelbrot set

## Future plans

- OCaml Julia sets
- Combine mandelbrot and julia set into one program since they are the exact same core logic
    - Cli args
- Render as image instead of text
    - GPU rendering?
- Hilbert curve
