# Fractals

Computing various fractals (currently only the Mandelbrot and Julia sets)

Fun way to learn a new language

## Current Implementations

- Python
    - Mandelbrot set (slow, low resolution)
- C
    - Mandelbrot set
    - Julia sets
- OCaml
    - Mandelbrot set

## Future plans

- OCaml Julia sets
- Combine Mandelbrot and Julia set into one program since they are the exact same core logic
    - CLI args
- Render as image instead of text
    - GPU rendering?
- Hilbert curve
